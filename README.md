# Flappy Bird clone game (FunnyBird)
This was my first ever game made within the Unity engine.<br/>
It is a flappy bird clone, the bird spirte was taken from the AssetStore ([i]the original link is no longer available[/i]) while the rest of the graphics were created by me using GIMP.<br/>
The game works on all Aspect Ratios, but only works on Androids OS.
