# Funny Bird - Unity
This was my first ever game made within the Unity engine.<br/>
It is a flappy bird clone, the bird spirte was taken from the AssetStore (<i>the original link is no longer available</i>) the rest of the graphics were created by me using GIMP.<br/>
The game works on all Aspect Ratios, but only works on Androids OS.
