# Flappy Bird clone game (FunnyBird)
This was my first ever game, actual game that works ^^ <br/>
It's a flappy bird clone, I made it using the Unity engine, the bird spirte was taken from the AssetStore while the rest of the graphics were created by me using GIMP. <br/>
The game works on all Aspect Ratios and even saves the high score.

<b>Used:</b>
- language: C#
- engine: Unity
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Other programs used: GIMP, Retro
